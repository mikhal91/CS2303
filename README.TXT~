This program calculates the average grades of the amount of grades inputted, and gives the highest and lowest values in the inputted set.

To use the program you would input ./grades (grade 1) (grade 2)... (grade x)

Typing ./grades 1 2 3 4 5 6
Will result in the output

Number of grades entered 6
Grade 1
Grade 2
Grade 3
Grade 4
Grade 5
Grade 6
Grade: 3.5000

This program handles the use of MAX_GRADES (20) by checking if the number of inputted grades are larger than 20, and then only processing the first 20 grades.

It will output
